## Project Overview
This Power BI project 📊 explores activewear sales data 👕 across different U.S. states 🗺️ from 2021 to 2024. It includes a full data cleaning process 🧹 using Power Query, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) 🔍 and the development of interactive dashboards 🧠📈. The goal was to uncover trends in revenue 💵, profit 📈, and product performance 🏷️ across various sales channels 🛒 and regions. The insights help highlight the best-performing products, regions, and sales strategies 🎯.

## Data Cleaning

The dataset was cleaned using Power Query in Power BI. Steps included:

- Formatting data types correctly 📅🔢  
- Filtering irrelevant entries 🚫  
- Creating new fields like Profit and Profit Ratio ➗  
- Merging related tables to enable proper analysis 🔗

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helped uncover trends and patterns in the data. These were some of the guiding questions:

- 🛍️ What product categories are generating the most profit?  
- 🌎 Which states bring in the highest revenue and profit?  
- 🛒 How do different sales channels (e.g., Marketplaces, Online Store) compare in performance?  
- 📅 What are the monthly trends in profit across years?  
- 👥 How has customer count changed over time?  
- 📦 What quantity trends exist across various product categories?

## Key Insights

- 🥇 Sneakers, Backpacks, and Jackets were the top-performing products

## Recommendations
1. **Focus Marketing on High-Performing Products**
   - **Sneakers, Backpacks, and Jackets** were top earners 🥇. Allocate more ad spend and feature them prominently in campaigns.
   - Create bundles or promotions around these items to increase average order value 🛍️.

2. **Leverage High-Profit Sales Channels**
   - **Marketplaces** outperformed other channels 💰. Consider exclusive deals or seasonal releases through those platforms.
   - Evaluate underperforming channels (e.g., Retail Stores) for optimization or resource reallocation.
     
3. **Reassess Low-Performing Products**
   - Socks and Tank Tops may be dragging margins 📉—consider reducing SKUs, improving design, or repositioning in niche markets (e.g., fitness bundles).

4. **Promote Consistently Performing Months**
   - If the first half of each year showed consistent profit growth 📅, plan product launches, influencer drops, or loyalty rewards during those periods.
